DS203 customized firmware by Gabriel Valky

DS203 is a nice open source oscilloscope. And this is an attempt to design improved GUI for the scope offering rich functions than the original not-so-user-friendly firmware. The source code is in C++ for better code organisation and it is possible to compile it on Windows and Linux machine. For speeding up the design process, you can compile this application as native Win32 app, this offers you the possibility to test new features on PC before final upload to the DS203 device. For windows users, there is a Visual Studio 2005 project file (Build/desktop_win32). For compiling the firmware for ARM Cortex M3 target device, there is a script in "Build" folder (arm_win32 for win32 platform, arm_linux for linux platform)
