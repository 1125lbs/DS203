Reading electricity meter
---------------------------

Photo-resistor is placed in front of LED diode signalling the power consumption. 1600 impulses corresponds to 1kWh. DSO203 is used for powering the resistor divider (photo resistor with 27kOhm resistor in series) and for processing the voltage from the divider for identification of the impulses. DSO User app displays the total consumed energy in kWh as such as the current consuption in kW.
